Architecture
Frontend: Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, Recharts, Leaflet/React-Leaflet, Framer Motion, Lucide Icons.
Backend: FastAPI (Python), SQLAlchemy 2.x, PostgreSQL (via psycopg2), Alembic migrations, JWT auth (PyJWT + Passlib/Bcrypt).

Note: This project connects to PostgreSQL only — there is no SQLite fallback. Make sure a Postgres server is running and reachable before starting the backend.

🛠️ Complete Setup & Run Guide

Follow these steps to get the project up and running locally from scratch.

0. Prerequisites
Python 3.10+
Node.js 18+ and npm
A running PostgreSQL instance (local or remote)
1. Backend Setup (FastAPI & Python)

First, set up your Python environment and start the backend server. Open a terminal and run the following commands:

bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# Create a virtual environment
py -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment (Windows)
venv\Scripts\activate
# For Mac/Linux use: source venv/bin/activate

# Install all required Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Create the Database Schema
# Start the server once to automatically create the 'bizdial' schema in Postgres
python -m uvicorn app.main:app--reload --port 8000
# (Press CTRL+C after you see "Application startup complete")

# 4. Run Alembic migrations to create/update database tables
alembic upgrade head

# 5. Seed the database with master categories and subcategories (40 categories)
python seed_categories.py

# Seed the database with default admin and owner users
python seed_users.py

# Seed the database with sample businesses, products, services, and SEO data
python master_seed.py

# Start the FastAPI server (runs on port 8000)
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000

Note on DATABASE_URL: If your Postgres password contains special characters (like @), percent-encode them in the connection string (e.g. @ → %40), or the URL will fail to parse.

Note on Database Migrations: This project uses Alembic for database schema management. If you modify any SQLAlchemy models in backend/models, generate a new migration script using alembic revision --autogenerate -m "your message" and apply it with alembic upgrade head.

Note: The backend API will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000. You can view the interactive API documentation at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.

2. Frontend Setup (React & Vite)

Next, open a new terminal window (keep the backend server running in the first one) to start the frontend interface:

bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install all Node modules and dependencies
npm install

# Copy the frontend environment file
cp .env.example .env   # on Windows: copy .env.example .env

# Start the Next.js development server
npm run dev

Note: The frontend application will be available at http://localhost:3000, and reads its API base URL from NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL (see .env).

🔐 Default Login Credentials

After successfully setting up both the frontend and backend (and running seed_users.py), you can log in to the different portals using the following demo credentials:

Super Admin Portal
URL: http://localhost:3000/login
Email: admin@justdial.com
Password: admin123

Business Owner Portal
URL: http://localhost:3000/login
Email: owner@justdial.com
Password: owner123

🧪 Verifying the Project Runs
Confirm Postgres is reachable and DATABASE_URL in .env is correct.
cd backend && python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000 — visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ and /docs to confirm the API is live.
cd frontend && npm run dev — visit http://localhost:3000 to confirm the UI loads and can reach the API (check the Network tab for successful /api/* calls).
Log in with the seeded admin/owner credentials above to verify both dashboards load.
